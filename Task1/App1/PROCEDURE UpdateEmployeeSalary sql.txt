To create and store the UpdateEmployeeSalary stored procedure in MySQL,

Create a Database name"Technobrain"

you can execute the following SQL query using a MySQL database management tool. For 
this cases I used MYSQL PhpMyAdmin

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary (
    IN empID INT,
    IN newSalary INT,
    OUT oldSalary INT
)
BEGIN
    -- Store the old salary value
    SELECT salary INTO oldSalary FROM employees WHERE id = empID;

    -- Update the salary of the employee
    UPDATE employees SET salary = newSalary WHERE id = empID;

    -- Return the old salary value
    SELECT oldSalary;
END //

DELIMITER ;
